            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <p>In the First, or <hi>Day-Book</hi> are Enter'd <hi>all Dealings</hi> as they occur, as of Goods Bought, or Sold, Money Receiv'd, or Paid, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> observing in each Article or Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel to Express the <hi>Date, Action, Person, Quantity,</hi> and <hi>Quality</hi> of the Goods, <hi>Price, Agreement,</hi> and <hi>Total.</hi>

               <p>In the second, or <hi>Ledger</hi> are Enter'd the <hi>Names</hi> of all those you Deal with upon Trust; allowing each a convenient space to Enter or Post such Dealings as shall be had with him, <hi>viz.</hi> On the Left-hand to Post all Articles for which he is In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted or Chargeable, and on the Right all such for which he ought to have Credit, or whereby he Discharges himself.</p>

            <div type="part">
               <head>The Order of Ballancing your Books.</head>
               <p n="1">1. Add up the Debtor or Left, and Creditor or Right-side of Each Person's Accompt in your Second Book or Ledger, Substracting that side of Each Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt which is Least from the other, and Enter the Remainder on the Left or Debtor-side of the Accompt of Ballance in your Fourth Book, if he, she, or they owe you Money, and on the Right or Creditor-side of the Person's Accompt: But, if you owe the Person Money, then on the Right or Creditor-side of the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt of Ballance in your Fourth Book, and on the Left or Debtor-side of the Person's Accompt; as may be seen in the several Accompts in the Ledger or Second Book, and in the Accompt of Ballance in the Fourth Book.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Add up the Debtor and Creditor-sides of your Accompt of Cash in your Third or Cash-Book; and, Substracting the Amount of the Creditor from that of the Debtor, Enter upon the Creditor-side of the said Accompt of Cash, <hi>By Ballance for somuch Ready Money;</hi> and on the Debtor-side of Ballance in your Fourth Book, <hi>To Cash,</hi> &amp;c. as may be seen in those two Accompts.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To Ballance your Accompt of Goods Bought and Sold in your Fourth Book, you must look over your <hi>Goods Remaining in your Shop,</hi> &amp;c. and set the value they cost you upon a Sheet of Paper, which when added into one Total Sum must be Enter'd on the Creditor-side of your Accompt of Goods Bought and Sold, saying, <hi>By Ballance for Goods Remaining,</hi> and on the Debtor-side of Ballance, <hi>To Goods for Remainders.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Then Add up your Accompt of Goods Bought and Sold in your Fourth Book, and if the Creditor-side Exceeds the Debtor, somuch is Gain'd Neat, which must be Enter'd on the Debtor-side of Accompt of Goods Bought and Sold, saying, <hi>To Ballance Gain'd Neat,</hi> and on the Creditor-side of Ballance, saying, <hi>By Goods for the Neat Gains:</hi> But if the Debtor-side of the Accompt of Goods Bought and Sold in your Fourth Book Exceeds the Creditor, somuch is Lost, which must be Enter'd on the Creditor-side of the Accompt of Goods Bought and Sold in your Fourth Book, saying, <hi>By Ballance for somuch Lost,</hi> and on the Debtor-side of Ballance, <hi>To Goods for somuch Lost:</hi> Having done thus much, if you have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded Right in your Posting, the Total of your Accompt of Ballance will Amount
<pb facs="tcp:37317:5"/>to the same on Each side; if it does not, you have committed some Error in Posting, which may be found in the following manner, and must be corrected.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The METHOD of Examining your BOOKS to sind out an ERROR.</head>
               <p>Begin at the first Article in your <hi>Day-Book,</hi> and Examin whether it has been Posted upon two several and proper Accompts in your other Books, upon the one, Debtor; and on the other, Creditor for the Sum that the Article carries in your <hi>Day-Book:</hi> If you find it has, so far you have Posted right, and may against the Sum in those two Accompts make a Tittle. Then proceed to the next Article in your <hi>Day-Book,</hi> and do the same with that, still making a Tittle to the Sum, as well on the Accompt were 'twas Posted Debtor as on that where 'twas Posted Creditor; and when you have thus gone thro' your <hi>Day-Book,</hi> then see whether against every Sum in your other Books you find a Tittle; for, where the Tittle is wanting, 'tis there you have committed an Error.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The way of Correcting an Error in Posting.</head>
               <p n="1">1. Suppose you have Posted in your <hi>Ledger, Cash-Book,</hi> or <hi>Book of Goods Bought and Sold</hi> a Debtor without a Creditor, or a Creditor without a Debtor; or suppose,</p>
               <p n="2">2. That an Accompt is Posted Debtor when it shou'd be Creditor, or Creditor when it shou'd be Debtor, or</p>
               <p n="3">3. That you have made an Entrance under a False Title.</p>
               <p>For the First, it being sound out as before directed, you may casily rectify it by Entring the Omission in its proper Accompt, whether Debtor or Creditor.</p>
               <p>For the Second, if you have Posted an Article to the Debtor of any Accompt instead of the Creditor, you may on the Debtor-side before the Article wrong Enter'd make this for any other Mark to signify its wrong Entrance, and on the Creditor of the same Accompt you must write, <hi>By an Error as per Contra,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring the same Sum as on the Debtor, and prefixing the same Mark. Thus ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving corrected that Error without blotting or scraping it out, you must Enter the Article right; but if you have Posted to the Creditor instead of the Debtor, you must do on the Creditor-side as in the former Instance you did on the Debtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side; and on the Debtor-side of the same Accompt you must write, <hi>To an Error as per Contra;</hi> (not forgeting to prefix this Mark †, or some other, and to Enter the same Sum on the Debtor, as you had falsely Enter'd on the Creditor,) and then Post the Article right.</p>
               <p>For the Third or Last, <hi>viz.</hi> An Entrance made under a False Title, you may make this †, or any other Mark against it; and then on the opposite side say, <hi>To,</hi> or <hi>By an Error as per Contra.</hi> Thus is that Error corrected, and then you must Enter the Parcel under its proper Title.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:37317:5"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Note,</hi> If any one shall find that Four Books are inconvenient, (that number being only propos'd necessary for Dispatch in Posting) they may keep the Three last all in one Book.</p>
               <p>Since the writing of these Sheets I have met with an Objection, used by some Tradesmen against Ballancing their Books once a Year, <hi>viz.</hi> That the time of their Country Chapmens coming to Town being uncertain, (with whom it is customary to make a Rest upon their Accompts sign'd by themselves,) makes it impracticable: But if they would well consider what I have said in Rule 9. upon the subject of Abatements, they'd find nothing more weak than that Objection; but to be more plain I'll instance an Example; Suppose say they that we Ballance our Books, and <hi>A.</hi> comes to Town some time after, and desiring a View of his Accompt, finds by our Ballance that he is indebted <hi>l.</hi> 10: 6: 8: examines the particulars and will have Abatement upon some of them, as suppose of <hi>l.</hi> 0: 15: 09: in the whole; how say they (if we comply to it,) shall we make our Books right for him to Sign? I answer that there's nothing more easy; <hi>viz.</hi> Upon the Paper of Abatements under the Title of Abatements made by me, to Enter the <hi>l.</hi> 0: 15: 09: and on the Credit of the Persons Accompt the same Sum, <hi>viz. Abated l.</hi> 0: 15: 09: Then on the said Credit Enter <hi>By Ballance car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to new Accompt in such a Folio l.</hi> 9: 10: 11, and upon the Debit of the New Accompt of the Person Enter <hi>To Ballance of Old Accompt brought from such a Folio, and Acknowledged to be due to</hi>— by (here let the Person Sign) <hi>l.</hi> 9: 10: 11. Thus you'll find the New Accompt of the Person to stand to your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.</p>
               <p>Thus much I have ventur'd to write upon this Subject, not finding it done by any other hand before, and knowing the Great Want of it, but refer its further Improvement to those that have more leisure and skill: And, as I am not at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent conscious of any Material Fault in these or the following Pages, so I hope for smaller ones (if any) to have your Pardon.</p>
